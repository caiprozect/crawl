Usability is the ease of use and learnability of a human-made object. The object of use can be a software application, website, book, tool, machine, process, or anything a human interacts with. A usability study may be conducted as a primary job function by a usability analyst or as a secondary job function by designers, technical writers, marketing personnel, and others.

Usability includes methods of measuring usability, such as needs analysis and the study of the principles behind an object's perceived efficiency or elegance. In human-computer interaction and computer science, usability studies the elegance and clarity with which the interaction with a computer program or a web site (web usability) is designed. Usability differs from user satisfaction and user experience because usability also considers usefulness.
Activities and Societies: HFI offers a complete training program consisting of four courses and one exam. 1: The Science and Art of Effective Web and Application Design 2: User-Centered Analysis and Conceptual Design 3: Usability Testing 4: Putting Research Into Practice

MS Thesis: Space-time codes for FSK/PSK modulation
The major objective of this thesis is to design the space-time trellis codes by using FSK/PSK modulation. Space-time coding has been introduced to improve the error performance as well as the information rate of wireless systems using multiple antennas. FSK/PSK is a modulation method defined over a set of signals varying in both frequency and phase. If one of the set of signals, with different carrier frequency is twisted with a phase angle, better error perfomance can be achieved. In this study space-time codes for 2FSK/4PSK modulation are obtained. The propose space-time 2FSK/4PSK codes are simulated on quasi-static Rayleigh fading channels for optimum and nonoptimum receivers. It is shown that the new codes provide better error performance than the conventional space-time 8PSK codes given in the literature.
